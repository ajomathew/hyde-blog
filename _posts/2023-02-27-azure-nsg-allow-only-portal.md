My Client got a requirement to block internet access inside a Subnet \ Vnet only using NSG and allow connection only to Azure Portal.

Client is using Azure Private Endpoints to enable private access to Azure Storage , Databricks and other services hence other resource access from within the VMs inside VM is working as expected.

The requirement from security team is to lock Azure Vnet & Subnet from internet and enable only direct Portal access.

Azure Documentation on Service Tags never mention about `AzurePortal` service tag but I was able to find it while checking outboud NSG rule.

With below combination of Azure Tags I managed to enable Azure Portal access and block internet.

Azure Service Tag combinations used with priority

 * AzurePortal (400)
 * AzureActiveDirectory (410)
 * AzureTrafficManager (430)
 * AzureFrontDoor.Frontend (440)
 * AzureResourceManager (450)
 
With Priority 500 I have set up a rule to block all internet access from Virtual network

|Priority | Name | Port | Pritocol | Source | Destination | Action |
| 400 | AzurePortal | All | All| Virtualnetwork(Tag) | AzurePortal(tag) | Allow|
| 410 | AzureActiveDirectory | All | All| Virtualnetwork(Tag) | AzureActiveDirectory(tag) | Allow|
| 430 | AzureTrafficManager | All | All| Virtualnetwork(Tag) | AzureTrafficManager(tag) | Allow|
| 440 | AzureFrontDoor.Frontend | All | All| Virtualnetwork(Tag) | AzureFrontDoor.Frontend(tag) | Allow|
| 450 | AzureResourceManager | All | All| Virtualnetwork(Tag) | AzureResourceManager(tag) | Allow|
| 500 | Block Outbound internet | Any | Any | Virtualnetwork(Tag) | Internet (tag)| Deny|
