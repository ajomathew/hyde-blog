Sendgrid stopped accepting `account username` and `password`. I was using powershell cmdlet send-mailmessage to run some of auditing scripts from VM's and it all broken due to this. Final solution with out much modification our script is done by setting username as apikey and password as APIKEYVALUE. Details of the same is available with [SendGrid Support page](https://sendgrid.com/docs/API_Reference/SMTP_API/integrating_with_the_smtp_api.html)
