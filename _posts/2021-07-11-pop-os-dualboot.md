During the first boot Pop OS does not show any boot selection menu. To fix that we can add 

`timeout <Seconds>`

to `sudo gedit /boot/efi/loader/loader.conf` and save.

Still if you are not able to view Windows in boot menu. You can follow instructions from this [page](https://github.com/spxak1/weywot/blob/main/Pop_OS_Dual_Boot.md)

The gist of it is that Copy Microsoft folder from UIEF partition of Windows to Pop OS UIEF partition.  It would looks like something like this

``` bash
root@pop-os:/boot/efi# cd EFI/
root@pop-os:/boot/efi/EFI# ls
BOOT  Linux  Microsoft  Pop_OS-077f0a72-1af9-49ec-94ec-458efccc5654  systemd
root@pop-os:/boot/efi/EFI# 
```
